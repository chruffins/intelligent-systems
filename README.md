# Intelligent Systems
Welcome to my Intelligent Systems homework repository! Intelligent Systems was one of my artificial intelligence electives that focused primarily on neural networks. For the homeworks, I was required to do tasks such as test ChatGPT's capability to do query error correction, simulate an Izhikevich neuron, and implement some neural networks.

## Homework 2
This was the simulation of an Izhikevich neuron with different parameters.

## Homework 3
This was the implementation of a perceptron, and training it on a subset of the NIST dataset of handwritten digits.

## Homework 4
This was the implementation of a feed-forward neural network with backpropagation. This includes the implementation of a two-layer classifier and an autoencoder.

## Homework 5
This was the implementation of a self-organized feature map, and some experimentation with using an autoencoder's hidden layer and the self-organized feature map as the hidden layer for a classifier neural network.

## Appendix
My code was messy. I may or may not refactor my code.
